In short, from a bunch of images these codes try to get GPS Longitude and Latitude and arrange it on an Excel Worksheet.
This gets the Exif information of an image(taken by smartphones or DSLR) from which the module extracts the GPS Information.

Steps]
1. Put images of which you want to know the GPS information into "images" directory.
2. Execute the where.exe(or command "python main.py").
3. Press the "GetData" button.
4. You can check the GPS data in "where_were_we.xlsx" and failure data in "fail_to_load.txt"

Anyone can use these codes and exe file for ANY purpose. Thanks :)
